	        Yugi's puzzle is stolen when the very force of evil itself tries to take over the world. Kaiba then gets a call from Ishizu Ishtar, promising to inform him of the show's plot. next Tea and Yami go on a date, with typically disastrous consequences. As Yami learns of his origins as an Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, Kaiba undertakes a potentially deadly videogame tutorial with the promise of confectionary delights as his only reward. Friendships are tested, blood is spilled, and cards are set in face-up position. Joey's estranged sister, Serenity, is finally going to have her eye operation. Unbeknownst to her, however, Joey has spent the money for the operation on children's trading cards.</p>

	            The Battle City Tournament starts off with a bang as Yugi goes head to head with a rather forgettable henchman. While Tristan attempts to get to first base with Serenity, Joey duels an extremely loud character named Espa Roba whose entire family both look and sound exactly like him for no adequately explored reason. Yami then goes missing! Marik takes up bird-watching, and Grandpa becomes a stuck record. Yami then seduces another greenskinned alien chick. Or maybe he just duels a mime. 
	            
	            after this two lovers are divided! Will their story have a happy ending? Or will it all end in tears? Kidnappings galore as Marik unleashes Project Steve, whilst Yugi and Kaiba are distracted by a relatively meaningless duel atop a huge building. Joey is then brainwashed into fighting Yugi by Marik. Meanwhile, Tristan battles a bunch of Steves. The tournament will then finally moves on to the height it has reached, literally! Thanks to Odion, a glimpse into the Ishtar family past is explored. Melvin goes bananas. Also, Mai finally shows that she is capable of dueling. </details></td>
